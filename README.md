# `ptmc` R Package 

## Parallel Tempering Markov Chain Monte Carlo 


This repository contains an R Package which takes an arbitrary likelihood and prior function for a set of fitted parameters and samples posterior values via a Metropolis Hastings algorithm with parallel tempering Markov chain Monte Carlo. This implementation is a generalised version of the algorithm outlined by [Miasojedow et al. 2012](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.1076.pdf).
